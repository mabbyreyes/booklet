## Description
This application is a book reviewer. It lets you simply take a picture of a books barcode from anywhere and get automatically genenerated reviews from Goodreads. It is intended to help decide whether you should read/buy the book in question.
I imagine the app would have seperate tabs at the bottom. Those tabs would include: profile where user would sign in to save searches to go back to later using google play sign in, a barcode scanner ready for use, a search option if the user wants to input the books information manually, and recommended books based on items scanned previosuly tab.
A long shot goal would be to add other servers like Google books and Amazon so the user has multiple sites to get a reliable review from.


## Intended users
* Readers looking for a new book based on review.
* Professors/Teachers searching for recommendations or reviews for educational purposes.
